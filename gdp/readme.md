# Overview 

GDP is currently the leading indicator for Economic Policy but it has several limitations 
- It is basically an Accounting Measures, measuring a phenomenon just as an Economic Transation hence 
  - A Phenomenon not leaving any Economic Transaction is not taken into account 
    - Examples 
      - Environment Quality 
      - Wealth Distribution  
      - Cultural level of the Society 
  - A Phenomenon is measured as the value of its economic transaction which can be a very biased measure
